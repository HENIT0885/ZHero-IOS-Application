# ZHero

## _Did someone just built a text to handwriting feature?_

ZHero is a student helper built to organized the chaos, pandemic has posed upon us.
JS and Python - powered Dashboard hosted on iOS environment.

## Features

- Chat feature embedded to chat with groups or individual.
- Calender added to track important assignments.
- Import webpages through link or just copy paste text to summarize whole document.
- Convert the type-written text into handwritten pdf with options of choosing rule or margins or text images.

> “Students do not learn much just sitting in classes listening to teachers, memorizing prepackaged assignments, and spitting out answers. They must talk about what they are learning, write reflectively about it, relate it to past experiences, and apply it to their daily lives. They must make what they learn part of themselves.” - Arthur W. Chickering and Stephen C. Ehrmann

## Tech

Dillinger uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

- Python3 - Used NLP to convert long-text into summary. 
- JS - Dynamic conversions of text to handwritten text pdf using javascript libraries.
- Firebase - Secure authentication and storage of user data. Being conscious about privacy and security.
- Basic Cocoa Framework (UIKit) - Provides runtime environment on iOS.

## Text Summary Example

Text after summarization:

> Computer science is the study of algorithmic processes, computational machines and computation itself.
[26] Despite its name, a significant amount of computer science does not involve the study of computers themselves.
[30] The term computics has also been suggested.
Peter Wegner argued that those paradigms are science, technology, and mathematics.
problem, one of the Millennium Prize Problems,[43] is an open problem in the theory of computation.
For industrial use, tool support is required.
is one of unsolved problems in theoretical computer science.

this has been summarized from the following link of wikipedia:

Python3 - Used NLP to convert long-text into summary. JavaScript , cocoa framework with UIKit for making the IOS app, HTML , CSS
